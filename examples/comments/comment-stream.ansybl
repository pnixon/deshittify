      "content": "Great article, Sarah! I particularly appreciate your point about transparency vs. competition. We're seeing this tension play out in real-time with companies like OpenAI and Google. The challenge is that the incentive structures currently reward secrecy over openness. How do we change that?",

Maybe something like mandatory algorithmic impact assessments for systems above certain thresholds, similar to environmental impact studies.
