## Project Title: ansybl 

### 1 Introduction

1-1 Project Overview  
A decentralized spec for sharing media. Be it text, image, video, or audio. 

1-2 Motivation  
Social network algorithms make people sadder, but freedom makes people happy.

1-3 Stakeholders  
Pete and Matt - lead designers

### 2 Project Scope

2-1 Features  
A simple file format for sharing and reading media.

This file format can be understood similarly to RSS where self-hosted files provide either direct access (via short text elements) or links to access (like video/audio/image) posts.

This technology can be used to replace modern social networks, RSS feeds for podcasts, Art/work galleries, blog back-ends, and many more use cases.

2-2 Non-Features  
Creating actual servers/clients to read/serve the content

2-3 Use Cases  
Do you want to share something with the internet? Then this is for you.

### 3 Requirements

3-1 Functional Requirements
3-1-1 File format
Options are Json, yaml, or some proprietary file format.

Base required fields for each type of media will be different but all items need a guid.
3-1-2 Search
We can handle this in a few ways
Webring style
Web crawler style
3-1-3 Discoverability
Items should have a list of tags used to enhance discoverability.

Tags work on an inverse squares method where the first tag is exponentially more important than the next, and so on.

3-2 Non-Functional Requirements
Does not require proprietary clients but allows people to create and require them for their own stuff.

3-3 Technical Requirements**


### 4 Architecture and Design
